# Welcome to Naunet

Naunet is a general-purpose astrochemistry tool modeling the chemical evolution in the universe. It can work with the network from KIDA or UMIST databases. KROME users can also easily bring their original network files here. 

The idea of Naunet is acting as a code-generator to generate C++ codes according to the input chemical network. These codes are prepared for the `CVODE` differential equation solver in `SUNDIALS` package and `Odeint` in boost library. For the multiple methods implemented in `CVODE` and `Odeint`, Naunet is capable of generating different codes for the methods. These codes can be compiled into libraries to be flexibly used.
